Hi! This is a scalable flight pricing analytics system that compares different machine learning algorithms and forward-feeding neural networks to assess pricing trends in American and Indian flights. Data collection was done through web scraping using SerpAPI and their Google Flights tool to find real-time flights in the biggest airport hubs in the US and feed them into the model as train & test data. I made a script that automated the parameter hypertuning process to improve accuracy. 

Tools: Python, TensorFlow, SerpAPI, Google Flights API
